PushQ
=====

When you're working toward a goal, whether it's related to fitness, work, or anything else, sometimes you need a push to keep you going. PushQ is an Android app which distills this idea to its very essence. 

* Create a task to raise a custom notification on your phone at a schedule	d time every day. 

*That's it?*

Well, almost.

* Specify a URL for the task and you will be sent to the page when clicking the notification. 

I've been using this to link to a 1-question Google form with a question like "How many pushups have you done today?" This way you can easily collect data on your progress, too! 

My theory is that this simple pushed question workflow *(PushQ, get it?)* acts kind of like a virtual coach. You might just look forward to reporting your progress at your "appointment"... or dread the prospect of recording a lack of progress when notification time comes around. Too crazy to work? Perhaps. Give it a try and see.


=== Potential future improvements
* Sound!
* Less crappy-looking icons
* Configurable sound/vibration/icon per task
* More flexible time settings: weekdays only, multiple times per day, etc.
